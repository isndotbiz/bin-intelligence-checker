# BIN Intelligence & 3DS Enforcement Checker

## Project Overview
A Streamlit web application that performs BIN (Bank Identification Number) intelligence and 3DS enforcement checks to help identify potential payment fraud risks. The application integrates with the 3ds-lookup RapidAPI to analyze card data and assess security configurations.

## Core Features
- **BIN/Card Checker**: Analyze 6-digit BINs or full card numbers for 3DS enforcement
- **URL Scraper**: Extract potential BIN numbers from websites and analyze them
- **Threshold Tracker**: Track 3DS triggering at specific dollar amounts
- **Database History**: Persistent storage and viewing of all analyzed data
- **Risk Classification**: Automatic categorization (Enforced, Weak, Unsafe)

## Technical Architecture
- **Frontend**: Streamlit web interface
- **Database**: SQLite with SQLAlchemy ORM
- **API**: 3ds-lookup RapidAPI integration
- **Scraping**: BeautifulSoup for web content extraction
- **Data Processing**: Pandas for data manipulation and display

## Database Schema
- `bin_records`: Store BIN check results with metadata
- `threshold_records`: Track dollar threshold testing results

## API Integration
- **Endpoint**: `https://3ds-lookup.p.rapidapi.com/cards/`
- **Authentication**: RapidAPI key authentication
- **Support**: Both BIN-only and full card number analysis
- **Optional**: IP address for geolocation context

## Recent Changes (2025-01-16)
- Fixed deprecated Pandas styling methods (applymap â†’ map)
- Updated validation to accept both 6-digit BINs and full card numbers
- Corrected API endpoint integration based on working code snippet
- Enhanced user interface with helpful examples
- Made IP address completely optional throughout the application
- Improved error handling and user feedback
- Removed broken external image URLs and replaced with emoji icons
- Added consistent icons to all tab headers for better UX
- Implemented comprehensive documentation and best practices
- Created README.md, CHANGELOG.md, LICENSE, and GitHub setup guides
- Added proper code documentation and project structure
- Prepared complete GitHub repository setup with all files

## User Preferences
- Prefer functional applications without unnecessary complexity
- Want to see comprehensive card data in database views
- Focus on practical fraud analysis tools
- Minimal IP address requirements for easier usage
- Requested comprehensive documentation and GitHub integration
- Prefers professional development practices and standards

## Current Status
Application is fully functional with proper API integration and database persistence. All major features are working including BIN checking, web scraping, threshold tracking, and data export capabilities. Project is now professionally documented and ready for GitHub repository creation with complete best practices implementation.
